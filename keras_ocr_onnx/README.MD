# Customized classification model of tensorflow2.0
 
This is implementation of classifcation model developed by tensorflow2.0 for customized compact version of squeezenet.

# Code

### install dependencies
```
python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```
```
tensorflow2.0
argparse
numpy
matplotlib
itertools
```

This code was tested with python 3.6

### Train
To train the customized model on your own image, put the desire tfrecord files generated by desire training images
using a converting tool 'datasetgenerator/genGenerator.py'  

```
python -m trainer.py  --gpu index-of-gpus
```
This model is trained from scratch using our training set.

### Inference
```
python -m inference.py --gpu index-of-gpus
```

### Inference by ncnn on PC or mobile
